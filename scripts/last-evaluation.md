## EVALUATION RESULTS

### 1. CHARACTER COUNT

- **Cursor Version**: 4,847 characters ✅ PASS
- **Windsurf Version**: 4,669 characters ✅ PASS
- Both versions are well under the 6000 character limit

### 2. CALCULATED SCORE

**Base Score: 10** **Deductions: -1 point**

- Missing form submission warnings (partial coverage only)

**FINAL SCORE: 9/10**

### 3. COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST

#### Character Limit Compliance

- ✅ Under 6000 characters total
- ✅ No unnecessary verbose explanations
- ✅ Efficient use of space

#### Content Requirements

- ✅ Technology stack clearly identified (Svelte 5, SvelteKit,
  TypeScript, vitest-browser-svelte)
- ✅ Core testing principles included (5 clear principles)
- ✅ Essential imports and setup patterns (comprehensive import block)
- ❌ Critical gotchas with solutions (partial - missing some key
  warnings)
- ✅ Code examples are complete and runnable
- ✅ Quality standards defined (code style section)

#### Technical Accuracy

- ✅ Emphasizes `page.getBy*()` over containers (explicitly warns
  against containers)
- ✅ Uses `await expect.element()` syntax (correct syntax shown)
- ✅ Includes proper import statements (complete import block)
- ❌ Warns about form submission issues (mentions hanging but
  incomplete coverage)
- ✅ Svelte 5 + vitest-browser-svelte specific (targeted content)

#### AI Assistant Compatibility

- ✅ Clear, actionable rules format
- ✅ Logical organization for AI consumption
- ✅ No ambiguous or conflicting guidance
- ✅ Suitable for Cursor/Windsurf integration

### 4. CRITICAL ISSUES

**None** - The rules are ready for AI assistant use.

### 5. RECOMMENDATIONS

#### Minor Improvements Needed:

1. **Expand Form Submission Warnings**

   ```typescript
   // Add to Common Errors section:
   ### Form Submission Race Conditions
   // ❌ Race condition - form submits before assertions
   await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' }).click();
   await expect.element(page.getByText('Success')).toBeVisible();

   // ✅ Wait for navigation or use force
   await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' }).click({ force: true });
   ```

2. **Add SSR Testing Pattern**
   ```typescript
   // Add brief SSR testing mention:
   ### SSR Tests
   // ✅ Test server-side rendering
   const html = render.toString(Component, { props });
   expect(html).toContain('expected content');
   ```

#### Strengths:

- Excellent organization with clear hierarchy
- Strong emphasis on locators vs containers
- Comprehensive error handling examples
- Perfect balance of brevity and completeness
- Great Svelte 5 runes coverage with `untrack()`
- Practical form validation lifecycle examples

**OVERALL ASSESSMENT**: Excellent quality AI assistant rules. The
content is technically accurate, well-organized, and perfectly sized
for AI consumption. The minor missing form submission edge cases don't
significantly impact usability.
