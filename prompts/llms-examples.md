Extract and curate code examples only from the provided documentation.

CRITICAL: You must return ONLY the actual code examples content as
markdown. Do NOT include any meta-commentary or explanations of what
you did.

Create sections with complete, runnable examples:

- Basic component tests (render, click, assertions)
- Form testing patterns (input filling, validation, submission)
- State testing with runes ($state, $derived, untrack)
- SSR testing examples (server-side rendering)
- Mocking examples (utilities, components, context)
- Error handling and troubleshooting examples
- Async testing patterns

Each example should be complete and runnable with:

- Necessary imports
- Full test structure (describe/test blocks)
- Clear assertions
- Brief context explaining the scenario

Focus on practical, copy-paste ready code examples.

Start with "# Sveltest Code Examples" and provide the actual markdown
content.
