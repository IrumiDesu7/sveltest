Extract only API reference content from the provided documentation.

CRITICAL: You must return ONLY the actual API reference content as
markdown. Do NOT include any meta-commentary or explanations of what
you did.

Focus on:

- Essential imports and functions with exact syntax
- Locator methods and queries (getByRole, getByText, etc.)
- Assertion patterns (expect.element syntax)
- User interaction methods (click, fill, etc.)
- Mocking patterns and setup
- SSR testing methods
- Code examples for each API method
- Common error handling patterns
- Setup and teardown patterns

Format as API reference with clear sections and code blocks. Remove
conceptual explanations, keep technical reference. Include parameter
types and return values where relevant.

Start with "# Sveltest API Reference" and provide the actual markdown
content.
