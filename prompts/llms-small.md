Create ultra-compressed essentials for small context windows.

CRITICAL: You must return ONLY the actual compressed documentation
content as markdown. Do NOT include any meta-commentary, explanations
of what you did, or descriptions of the process.

Context: Other formats available are llms-medium.txt (detailed) and
llms-api.txt (complete API).

Your role: Absolute essentials only.

Include ONLY:

- Core imports and basic setup (describe/test structure)
- Essential testing patterns (locators vs containers with clear
  examples)
- Critical gotchas and common errors with solutions
- Basic code examples for first component test
- Form testing warnings and patterns
- Basic assertions (expect.element syntax)
- Links to other formats

Target: <10% of full content, maximum utility.

Start with "# Sveltest Testing Documentation" and provide the actual
markdown content.
