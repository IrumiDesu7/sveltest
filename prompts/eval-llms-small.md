VARIANT: Ultra-compressed Essentials

EVALUATION CRITERIA:

1. CHARACTER COUNT: Must be under 2,000 characters (ultra-compressed)
2. ESSENTIAL COVERAGE: Core patterns without verbose explanations
3. CODE QUALITY: At least 1 complete test example with imports
4. CRITICAL PATTERNS: Locators vs containers emphasis
5. GOTCHA WARNINGS: Form submission and common error guidance

QUANTITATIVE CHECKS:

- ✅/❌ Character count under 2,000 (maximum compression)
- ✅/❌ Contains core imports (vitest, render, page, expect)
- ✅/❌ Shows `page.getBy*()` usage over containers
- ✅/❌ Includes `await expect.element()` syntax
- ✅/❌ At least 1 complete test example
- ✅/❌ Warns about form submission gotchas
- ✅/❌ Links to other format variants

SCORING SYSTEM (deduct points as specified):

- DEDUCT 3 points: Over 2,000 characters
- DEDUCT 2 points: Missing core imports in examples
- DEDUCT 2 points: Shows containers instead of locators
- DEDUCT 1 point: Missing async/await in assertions
- DEDUCT 1 point: No complete test example provided
- DEDUCT 1 point: Missing form testing warnings
- DEDUCT 1 point: No cross-references to other formats

REQUIRED ESSENTIALS:

- Core imports and basic setup
- Essential testing patterns (locators vs containers)
- Critical gotchas and solutions
- Basic code examples for first component test
- Form testing warnings
- Basic assertions (expect.element syntax)
- Links to other formats (medium, API)

COMPRESSION REQUIREMENTS:

- Maximum utility in minimum space
- Bullet points over paragraphs
- No redundant explanations
- Essential patterns only
- Every character must add value

Please evaluate the following content and provide:

1. COMPRESSION RESULTS: Character count and essentials checklist
2. CALCULATED SCORE: Base 10, minus deductions (minimum 1)
3. STRENGTHS: What the compressed content does well
4. ISSUES: What needs improvement for compression goals
5. MISSING: Required essentials that are missing
6. RECOMMENDATIONS: Specific compression improvements

Be specific and provide exact character counts and compression
feedback.
